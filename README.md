# dynastr
This library, which is a requirement for the C version of [strcal](https://github.com/Amirreza-Ipchi-Haq/strcal), is designed specifically to work with strings allocated in the heap. The reason I've created this is to seperate the dynamic string operations from the C version of [strcal](https://github.com/Amirreza-Ipchi-Haq/strcal).
## How to use
You can use it by putting the header file next to your code and include it with `#include"dynastr.h"`.
## Reference
The reference is in the `Reference.md` file which you can view it from here.
